## Website Scrapers

### Course Platforms
- **Class Central** - AI course aggregator
  - Scrapes latest AI courses from multiple platforms
  - Note: May require selector updates as site changes

### Adding More Scrapers

To add Coursera, edX, Udacity, etc., you'll need to:
1. Inspect the site's HTML structure
2. Identify CSS selectors for:
   - Item container (e.g., `.course-card`)
   - Title (e.g., `.course-title`)
   - Link (e.g., `a.course-link`)
   - Description (e.g., `.course-description`)
3. Add to `config.js` under `siteScrapers`

**Important**: Many sites have Terms of Service restricting scraping. Consider using official APIs when available.

## Categorization Heuristics

The agent uses keyword patterns to categorize items:

### Course Patterns
- course, coursera, edx, udemy, udacity, classcentral
- specialization, nanodegree, tutorial, learning, fast.ai

### News Patterns
- arxiv, reddit, hn, hackernews, news, blog
- announcement, press, release
- openai, deepmind, anthropic

Items not matching these patterns are categorized as "reading".
